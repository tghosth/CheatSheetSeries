Create misuse and abuse cases to misuse or exploit the weaknesses of controls in software features to attack an application. Use abuse-case models for an application to serve as fuel for identification of concrete security tests that directly or indirectly exploit the abuse scenarios.\n\nAbuse of functionality, sometimes referred to as a \u201cbusiness logic attack\u201d, depends on the design and implementation of application functions and features. An example is using a password reset flow to enumerate accounts. As part of business logic testing, identify the business rules that are important for the application and turn them into experiments to verify whether the application properly enforces the business rule. For example, on a stock trading application, is the attacker allowed to start a trade at the beginning of the day and lock in a price, hold the transaction open until the end of the day, then complete the sale if the stock price has risen or cancel if the price dropped?\n</code></pre> <p>Open SAMM source: Verification Requirement Driven Testing Stream B</p> <p>Another way to achieve the building of the list can be the following (more bottom-up and collaboratively oriented):</p> <p>Make a workshop that includes people with the following profiles:</p> <ul> <li>Business analyst: Will be the business key people that will describe each feature from a business point of view.</li> <li>Risk analyst: Will be the company's risk personnel that will evaluate the business risk from a proposed attack (sometimes it is the Business analyst depending on the company).</li> <li>Penetration tester: Will be the attacker that will propose attacks that they can perform on the business feature(s) in question. If the company does not have a person with this profile then it is possible to request the service of an external specialist. If possible, include 2 penetration testers with different backgrounds in order to increase the number of possible attacks that will be identified and considered.</li> <li>Technical leaders of the projects: Will be the project technical people and will allow technical exchange about attacks and countermeasures identified during the workshop.</li> <li>Quality assurance analyst or functional tester: Personnel that may have a good sense of how the application/functionality is intended to work (positive testing), not work (negative testing), and what things cause it to fail (failure cases).</li> </ul> <p>During this workshop (duration will depend on the size of the feature list, but 4 hours is a good start) all business features that will be part of the project or the sprint will be processed. The output of the workshop will be a list of attacks (abuse cases) for all business features. All abuse cases will have a risk rating that allows for filtering and prioritization.</p> <p>It is important to take into account Technical and Business kind of abuse cases and mark them accordingly.</p> <p>Example:</p> <ul> <li>Technical flagged abuse case: Add Cross Site Scripting injection into a comment input field.</li> <li>Business flagged abuse case: Ability to modify arbitrary the price of an article in an online shop prior to pass an order causing the user to pay a lower amount for the wanted article.</li>

It is targeted to be used by developers to understand and manage application security risks as they design and change an application, as well as by application security specialists doing a security risk assessment. The focus here is on protecting an application from external attack - it does not take into account attacks on the users or operators of the system (e.g. malware injection, social engineering attacks), and there is less focus on insider threats, although the principles remain the same. The internal attack surface is likely to be different to the external attack surface and some users may have a lot of access.</p> <p>Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.</p> <p>Attack Surface Analysis is usually done by security architects and pen testers. But developers should understand and monitor the Attack Surface as they design and build and change a system.</p> <p>Attack Surface Analysis helps you to:</p> <ol> <li>identify what functions and what parts of the system you need to review/test for security vulnerabilities</li> <li>identify high risk areas of code that require defense-in-depth protection - what parts of the system that you need to defend</li> <li>identify when you have changed the attack surface and need to do some kind of threat assessment</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html#defining-the-attack-surface-of-an-application","title":"Defining the Attack Surface of an Application","text":"<p>The Attack Surface describes all of the different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out.</p> <p>The Attack Surface of an application is:</p> <ol> <li>the sum of all paths for data/commands into and out of the application, and</li> <li>the code that protects these paths (including resource connection and authentication, authorization, activity logging, data validation and encoding)</li> <li>all valuable data used in the application, including secrets and keys, intellectual property, critical business data, personal data and PII, and</li> <li>the code that protects these data (including encryption and checksums, access auditing, and data integrity and operational security controls).</li> </ol> <p>You overlay this model with the different types of users - roles, privilege levels - that can access the system (whether authorized or not).

You can then count the number of attack points of each type, then choose some cases for each type, and focus your review/assessment on those cases.</p> <p>With this approach, you don't need to understand every endpoint in order to understand the Attack Surface and the potential risk profile of a system.

For web apps you can use a tool like the OWASP ZAP or Arachni or Skipfish or w3af or one of the many commercial dynamic testing and vulnerability scanning tools or services to crawl your app and map the parts of the application that are accessible over the web.

Using this method you calculate an overall attack surface score for the system, and measure this score as changes are made to the system and to how it is deployed. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon built on this work to develop a formal way to calculate an Attack Surface Metric for large systems like SAP. They calculate the Attack Surface as the sum of all entry and exit points, channels (the different ways that clients or external systems connect to the system, including TCP/UDP ports, RPC end points, named pipes...) and untrusted data elements. Then they apply a damage potential/effort ratio to these Attack Surface elements to identify high-risk areas.</p> <p>Note that deploying multiple versions of an application, leaving features in that are no longer used just in case they may be needed in the future, or leaving old backup copies and unused code increases the Attack Surface. Source code control and robust change management/configurations practices should be used to ensure the actual deployed Attack Surface matches the theoretical one as closely as possible.</p> <p>Backups of code and data - online, and on offline media - are an important but often ignored part of a system's Attack Surface.

If you add another field to that page, or another web page like it, while technically you have made the Attack Surface bigger, you haven't increased the risk profile of the application in a meaningful way. Each of these incremental changes is more of the same, unless you follow a new design or use a new framework.</p> <p>If you add another web page that follows the same design and using the same technology as existing web pages, it's easy to understand how much security testing and review it needs. If you add a new web services API or file that can be uploaded from the Internet, each of these changes have a different risk profile again - see if the change fits in an existing bucket, see if the existing controls and protections apply. If you're adding something that doesn't fall into an existing bucket, this means that you have to go through a more thorough risk assessment to understand what kind of security holes you may open and what protections you need to put in place.</p> <p>Changes to session management, authentication and password management directly affect the Attack Surface and need to be reviewed. So do changes to authorization and access control logic, especially adding or changing role definitions, adding admin users or admin functions with high privileges. Similarly for changes to the code that handles encryption and secrets. Fundamental changes to how data validation is done. And major architectural changes to layering and trust relationships, or fundamental changes in technical architecture \u2013 swapping out your web server or database platform, or changing the runtime operating system.</p> <p>As you add new user types or roles or privilege levels, you do the same kind of analysis and risk assessment. Overlay the type of access across the data and functions and look for problems and inconsistencies. It's important to understand the access model for the application, whether it is positive (access is deny by default) or negative (access is allow by default). In a positive access model, any mistakes in defining what data or functions are permitted to a new user type or role are easy to see. In a negative access model, you have to be much more careful to ensure that a user does not get access to data/functions that they should not be permitted to.</p> <p>This kind of threat or risk assessment can be done periodically, or as a part of design work in serial / phased / spiral / waterfall development projects, or continuously and incrementally in Agile / iterative development.</p> <p>Normally, an application's Attack Surface will increase over time as you add more interfaces and user types and integrate with other systems. You also want to look for ways to reduce the size of the Attack Surface when you can by simplifying the model (reducing the number of user levels for example or not storing confidential data that you don't absolutely have to), turning off features and interfaces that aren't being used, by introducing operational controls such as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and real-time application-specific attack detection.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html","title":"Authentication Cheat Sheet","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be.

Authorization is distinct from authentication which is the process of verifying an entity's identity. When designing and developing a software solution, it is important to keep these distinctions in mind. A user who has been authenticated (perhaps by providing a username and password) is often not authorized to access every resource and perform every action that is technically possible through a system. For example, a web app may have both regular users and admins, with the admins being able to perform actions the average user is not privileged to do so, even though they have been authenticated. Additionally, authentication is not always required for accessing resources; an unauthenticated user may be authorized to access certain public resources, such as an image or login page, or even an entire web app.</p> <p>The objective of this cheat sheet is to assist developers in implementing authorization logic that is robust, appropriate to the app's business context, maintainable, and scalable. The guidance provided in this cheat sheet should be applicable to all phases of the development lifecycle and flexible enough to meet the needs of diverse development environments.</p> <p>Flaws related to authorization logic are a notable concern for web apps. Broken Access Control was ranked as the most concerning web security vulnerability in OWASP's 2021 Top 10 and asserted to have a \"High\" likelihood of exploit by MITRE's CWE program.

Attackers may be able read, create, modify, or delete resources that were meant to be protected (thus jeopardizing their confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability); however, the actual impact of such actions is necessarily linked to the criticality and sensitivity of the compromised resources. Thus, the business cost of a successfully exploited authorization flaw can range from very low to extremely high.</p> <p>Both entirely unauthenticated outsiders and authenticated (but not necessarily authorized) users can take advantage of authorization weaknesses.  Although honest mistakes or carelessness on the part of non-malicious entities may enable authorization bypasses, malicious intent is typically required for access control threats to be fully realized.  Horizontal privilege elevation (i.e. being able to access another user's resources) is an especially common weakness that an authenticated user may be able to take advantage of. Faults related to authorization control can allow malicious insiders and outsiders alike to view, modify, or delete sensitive resources of all forms (databases records, static files, personally identifiable information (PII), etc.) or perform actions, such as creating a new account or initiating a costly order, that they should not be privileged to do.

There is a third, more recent, model which has gained popularity: Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC). The decision between the models has significant implications for the entire SDLC and should be made as early as possible.</p> <ul> <li> <p>RBAC is a model of access control in which access is granted or denied based upon the roles assigned to a user. Permissions are not directly assigned to an entity; rather, permissions are associated with a role and the entity inherits the permissions of any roles assigned to it. Generally, the relationship between roles and users can be many-to-many, and roles may be hierarchical in nature.</p> </li> <li> <p>ABAC may be defined as an access control model where \"subject requests to perform operations on objects are granted or denied based on assigned attributes of the subject, assigned attributes of the object, environment conditions, and a set of policies that are specified in terms of those attributes and conditions\" (NIST SP 800-162, pg. 7]). As defined in NIST SP 800-162, attributes are simply characteristics that be represented as name-value pairs and assigned to a subject, object, or the environment. Job role, time of day, project name, MAC address, and creation date are but a very small sampling of possible attributes that highlight the flexibility of ABAC implementations.</p> </li> <li> <p>ReBAC is an access control model that grants access based on the relationships between resources. For instance, allowing only the user who created a post to edit it. This is especially necessary in social network applications, like Twitter or Facebook, where users want to limit access to their data (tweets or posts) to people they choose (friends, family, followers).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Although RBAC has a long history and remains popular among software developers today, ABAC and ReBAC should typically be preferred for application development. Their advantages over RBAC include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Support fine-grained, complex Boolean logic. In RBAC, access decisions are made on the presence or absence of roles; that is, the main characteristic of a requesting entity considered is the role(s) assigned to it. Such simplistic logic does a poor job of supporting object-level or horizontal access control decisions and those that require multiple factors.</p> <ul> <li>ABAC greatly expands both the number and type of characteristics that can be considered. In ABAC, a \"role\" or job function can certainly be one attribute assigned to a subject, but it need not be considered in isolation (or at all if this characteristic is not relevant to the particular access requested). Furthermore, ABAC can incorporate environmental and other dynamic attributes, such as time of day, type of device used, and geographic location. Denying access to a sensitive resource outside of normal business hours or if a user has not recently completely mandatory training are just a couple of examples where ABAC could meet access control requirements that RBAC would struggle to fulfill. Thus, ABAC is more effective than RBAC in addressing the principle of least privileges.</li> <li>ReBAC, since it supports assigning relationships between direct objects and direct users (and not just a role), allows for fine-grained permissions. Some systems also support algebraic operators like AND and NOT to express policies like \"if this user has relationship X but not relationship Y with the object, then grant access\".</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Robustness. In large projects or when numerous roles are present, it is easy to miss or improperly perform role checks (OWASP C7: Enforce Access Controls). This can result in both too much and too little access. This is especially true in RBAC implementations where a role hierarchy is not present and multiples role checks must be chained to have the desired impact (i.e. ( <code>if(user.hasAnyRole(\"SUPERUSER\", \"ADMIN\", \"ACCT_MANAGER\")</code> ))).</p> </li> <li>Speed. In RBAC, \"role explosion\" can occur when a system defines too many roles. If users send their credential and roles through means like HTTP headers, which have size limits, there may not be enough space to include all of the user's roles. A viable workaround to this problem is to only send the user ID, and then the application retrieves the user's roles, but this will increase the latency of every request.</li> <li>Supports Multi-Tenancy and Cross-Organizational Requests. RBAC is poorly suited for use cases where distinct organizations or customers will need access to the same set of protected resources. Meeting such requirement with RBAC would require highly cumbersome methods such as configuring rule sets for each customer in a multi-tenant environment or requiring pre-provisioning of identities for cross-organizational requests (OWASP C7; NIST SP 800-162). By contrast, as long as attributes are consistently defined, ABAC implementations allow access control decisions to be \"executed and administered in the same or separate infrastructures, while maintaining appropriate levels of security\" (NIST SP 800-162, pg. 6]).</li> <li>Ease of Management. Although the initial setup for RBAC is often simpler than ABAC, this short-term benefit quickly vanishes as the scale and complexity of a system grows. In the beginning, a couple of simple roles, such as User and Admin, may suffice for some apps, but this is very unlikely to hold true for any length of time in production applications. As roles become more numerous, both testing and auditing, critical processes for establishing trust in one's codebase and logic, become more difficult (OWASP C7). By contrast, ABAC and ReBAC are far more expressive, incorporate attributes and Boolean logic that better reflects real-world concerns, are easier to update when access-control needs change, and encourages the separation of policy management from  enforcement and provisioning of identities (NIST SP 800-162; see also XACML-V3.0 for a standard that highlights these benefits))</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html#ensure-lookup-ids-are-not-accessible-even-when-guessed-or-cannot-be-tampered-with","title":"Ensure Lookup IDs are Not Accessible Even When Guessed or Cannot Be Tampered With","text":"<p>Applications often expose the internal object identifiers (such as an account number or Primary Key in a database) that are used to locate and reference an object. This ID may exposed as a query parameter, path variable, \"hidden\" form field or elsewhere. For example:</p> <p><code>https://mybank.com/accountTransactions?acct_id=901</code></p> <p>Based on this URL, one could reasonably assume that the application will return a listing of transactions and that the transactions returned will be restricted to a particular account - the account indicated in the <code>acct_id</code> param. But what would happen if the user changed the value of the <code>acct_id</code> param to another value such as <code>523</code>. Will the user be able to view transactions associated with another account even if it does not belong to him? If not, will the failure simply be the result of the account \"523\" not existing/not being found or will it be due to a failed access control check? Although this example may be an oversimplification, it illustrates a very common security flaw in application development - CWE 639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key.  When exploited, this weakness can result in authorization bypasses, horizontal privilege escalation and, less commonly, vertical privilege escalation (see CWE-639). This type of vulnerability also represents a form of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The following paragraphs will describe the weakness and possible mitigations.</p> <p>In the example of above, the lookup ID was not only exposed to the user and readily tampered with, but also appears to have been a fairly predictable, perhaps sequential, value.  While one can use various techniques to mask or randomize these IDs and make them hard to guess, such an approach is generally not sufficient by itself. A user should not be able to access a resource they do not have permissions simply because they are able to guess and manipulate that object's identifier in a query param or elsewhere. Rather than relying on some form of security through obscurity, the focus should be on controlling access to the underlying objects and/or the identifiers themselves. Recommended mitigations for this weakness include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid exposing identifiers to the user when possible. For example it should be possible to retrieve some objects, such as account details,  based solely on currently authenticated user's identity and attributes (e.g. through information contained in a securely implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) or server-side session).</li> <li>Implement user/session specific indirect references using a tool such as OWASP ESAPI (see OWASP 2013 Top 10 - A4 Insecure Direct Object References)</li> <li>Perform access control checks on every request for the specific object or functionality being accessed.

This article will examine Microsoft and GCC toolchains for the C, C++ and Objective C languages. It will guide you through the steps you should take to create executables with firmer defensive postures and increased integration with the available platform security. Effectively configuring the toolchain also means your project will enjoy a number of benefits during development, including enhanced warnings and static analysis, and self-debugging code.</p> <p>There are four areas to be examined when hardening the toolchain: configuration, preprocessor, compiler, and linker. Nearly all areas are overlooked or neglected when setting up a project. The neglect appears to be pandemic, and it applies to nearly all projects including Auto-configured projects, Makefile-based, Eclipse-based, Visual Studio-based, and Xcode-based. Its important to address the gaps at configuration and build time because its difficult to impossible to add hardening on a distributed executable after the fact on some platforms.</p> <p>This is a prescriptive article, and it will not debate semantics or speculate on behavior. Some information, such as the C/C++ committee's motivation and pedigree for <code>program diagnostics</code>, <code>NDEBUG</code>, <code>assert</code>, and <code>abort()</code>, appears to be lost like a tale in the Lord of the Rings. As such, the article will specify semantics (for example, the philosophy of 'debug' and 'release' build configurations), assign behaviors (for example, what an assert should do in a 'debug' and 'release' build configurations), and present a position. If you find the posture is too aggressive, then you should back off as required to suite your taste.</p> <p>A secure toolchain is not a silver bullet. It is one piece of an overall strategy in the engineering process to help ensure success. It will compliment existing processes such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, secure coding, negative test suites, and the like. Tools such as Valgrind and Helgrind will still be needed. And a project will still require solid designs and architectures.</p> <p>The OWASP ESAPI C++ project eats its own dog food.

Debug will be used for development and include full instrumentation. Release will be configured for production. The difference between the two settings is usually optimization level and debug level. A third build configuration is Test, and its usually a special case of Release.</p> <p>For debug and release builds, the settings are typically diametrically opposed. Debug configurations have no optimizations and full debug information; while Release builds have optimizations and minimal to moderate debug information. In addition, debug code has full assertions and additional library integration, such as mudflaps and malloc guards such as <code>dmalloc</code>.</p> <p>The Test configuration is often a Release configuration that makes everything public for testing and builds a test harness. For example, all member functions public (C++ class) and all interfaces (library or shared object) should be made available for testing. Many Object Oriented purist oppose testing private interfaces, but this is not about object oriented-ness.

Though many do not realize, debug code is more highly valued than release code because its adorned with additional instrumentation. The debug instrumentation will cause a program to become nearly \"self-debugging\", and help you catch mistakes such as bad parameters, failed API calls, and memory problems.</p> <p>Self-debugging code reduces your time during trouble shooting and debugging. Reducing time under the debugger means you have more time for development and feature requests. If code is checked in without debug instrumentation, it should be fixed by adding instrumentation or rejected.</p> <p>For GCC, optimizations and debug symbolication are controlled through two switches: <code>-O</code> and <code>-g</code>. You should use the following as part of your <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for a minimal debug session:</p> <pre><code>-O0 -g3 -ggdb\n</code></pre> <p><code>-O0</code> turns off optimizations and <code>-g3</code> ensures maximum debug information is available. You may need to use <code>-O1</code> so some analysis is performed. Otherwise, your debug build will be missing a number of warnings not present in release builds. <code>-g3</code> ensures maximum debugging information is available for the debug session, including symbolic constants and <code>#defines</code>. <code>-ggdb</code> includes extensions to help with a debug session under GDB. For completeness, Jan Krachtovil stated <code>-ggdb</code> currently has no effect in a private email.</p> <p>Release builds should also consider the configuration pair of <code>-mfunction-return=thunk</code> and <code>-mindirect-branch=thunk</code>. These are the \"Reptoline\" fix which is an indirect branch used to thwart speculative execution CPU vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown. The CPU cannot tell what code to <code>speculatively</code> execute because it is an indirect (as opposed to a direct) branch. This is an extra layer of indirection, like calling a pointer through a pointer.</p> <p>Debug build should also define <code>DEBUG</code>, and ensure <code>NDEBUG</code> is not defined. <code>NDEBUG</code> removes \"program diagnostics\"; and has undesirable behavior and side effects which discussed below in more detail. The defines should be present for all code, and not just the program. You use it for all code (your program and included libraries) because you need to know how they fail too (remember, you take the bug report - not the third party library).</p> <p>In addition, you should use other relevant flags, such as <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code>. Ensuring a frame pointer exists makes it easier to decode stack traces. Since debug builds are not shipped, its OK to leave symbols in the executable. Programs with debug information do not suffer performance hits. See, for example, How does the gcc -g option affect performance?</p> <p>Finally, you should ensure your project includes additional diagnostic libraries, such as <code>dmalloc</code> and Address Sanitizer. A comparison of some memory checking tools can be found at Comparison Of Memory Tools.

The files are part of the auto tools chain and include <code>m4</code> and the various <code>*.in</code>, <code>*.ac</code> (autoconf), and <code>*.am</code> (automake) files. At times, you will have to open them, or the resulting makefiles, to tune the \"stock\" configuration.</p> <p>There are three downsides to the command-line configuration tools in the toolchain: (1) they often ignore user requests, (2) they cannot create configurations, and (3) security is often not a goal.</p> <p>To demonstrate the first issue, confider your project with the following: <code>configure</code> <code>CFLAGS=\"-Wall</code> <code>-fPIE\"</code> <code>CXXFLAGS=\"-Wall</code> <code>-fPIE\"</code> <code>LDFLAGS=\"-pie\"</code>. You will probably find the auto tools ignored your request, which means the command below will not produce expected results.

Its not entirely Autoconf's or Automake's fault - Make and its inability to detect changes is the underlying problem. Specifically, Make only checks modification times of prerequisites and targets, and does not check things like <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code>. The net effect is you will not receive expected results when you issue <code>make</code> <code>debug</code> and then <code>make</code> <code>test</code> or <code>make</code> <code>release</code>.</p> <p>Finally, you will probably be disappointed to learn tools such as Autoconf and Automake miss many security related opportunities and ship insecure out of the box.

Unfortunately, Make has a number of short comings (Recursive Make Considered Harmful and What's Wrong With GNU make?), and can cause some discomfort. Despite issues with Make, ESAPI C++ uses Make primarily for three reasons: first, its omnipresent; second, its easier to manage than the Auto Tools family; and third, <code>libtool</code> was out of the question.</p> <p>Consider what happens when you: (1) type <code>make</code> <code>debug</code>, and then type <code>make</code> <code>release</code>.

ESAPI C++ does its best to ensure a user's flags are honored via <code>override</code> as shown above, but other projects do not. For example, consider a project that should be built with Position Independent Executable (PIE or ASLR) enabled and data execution prevention (DEP) enabled. Dismissing user settings combined with insecure out of the box settings (and not picking them up during auto-setup or auto-configure) means a program built with the following will likely have neither defense:</p> <pre><code>make CFLAGS=\"-fPIE\" CXXFLAGS=\"-fPIE\" LDFLAGS=\"-pie -z,noexecstack, -z,noexecheap\"\n</code></pre> <p>Defenses such as ASLR and DEP are especially important on Linux because Data Execution - not Prevention - is the norm.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html#integration","title":"Integration","text":"<p>Project level integration presents opportunities to harden your program or library with domain specific knowledge. For example, if the platform supports Position Independent Executables (PIE or ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP), then you should integrate with it. The consequences of not doing so could result in exploitation. As a case in point, see KingCope's 0-days for MySQL in December, 2012 (CVE-2012-5579 and CVE-2012-5612, among others). Integration with platform security would have neutered a number of the 0-days.</p> <p>You also have the opportunity to include helpful libraries that are not need for business logic support. For example, if you are working on a platform with DMalloc or Address Sanitizer, you should probably use it in your debug builds. For Ubuntu, DMalloc available from the package manager and can be installed with <code>sudo apt install libdmalloc5</code>. For Apple platforms, its available as a scheme option. Address Sanitizer is available in GCC 4.8 and above for many platforms.</p> <p>In addition, project level integration is an opportunity to harden third party libraries you chose to include. Because you chose to include them, you and your users are responsible for them. If you or your users endure a <code>SP800-53</code> audit, third party libraries will be in scope because the supply chain is included (specifically, item SA-12, Supply Chain Protection). The audits are not limited to those in the US Federal arena - financial institutions perform reviews too. A perfect example of violating this guidance is CVE-2012-1525, which was due to Adobe's inclusion of a defective Sablotron library.</p> <p>Another example is including OpenSSL. You know (1) SSLv2 is insecure, (2) SSLv3 is insecure, and (3) compression is insecure (among others). In addition, suppose you don't use hardware and engines, and only allow static linking. Given the knowledge and specifications, you would configure the OpenSSL library as follows:</p> <pre><code>$ Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc -no-hw -no-engine -no-comp -no-shared\n    -no-dso -no-ssl2 -no-ssl3 --openssldir=\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>Note Well: you might want engines, especially on Ivy Bridge microarchitectures (3rd generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors). To have OpenSSL use the processor's random number generator (via the of <code>rdrand</code> instruction), you will need to call OpenSSL's <code>ENGINE_load_rdrand()</code> function and then <code>ENGINE_set_default</code> with <code>ENGINE_METHOD_RAND</code>. See OpenSSL's Random Numbers for details.</p> <p>If you configure without the switches, then you will likely have vulnerable code/libraries and risk failing an audit. If the program is a remote server, then the following command will reveal if compression is active on the channel:</p> <pre><code>echo \"GET / HTTP1.0\" | openssl s_client -connect &lt;nowiki&gt;example.com:443&lt;/nowiki&gt;\n</code></pre> <p><code>nm</code> or <code>openssl</code> <code>s_client</code> will show that compression is enabled in the client. In fact, any symbol within the <code>OPENSSL_NO_COMP</code> preprocessor macro will bear witness since <code>-no-comp</code> is translated into a <code>CFLAGS</code> define.</p> <pre><code>$ nm /usr/local/ssl/iphoneos/lib/libcrypto.a 2&gt;/dev/null | egrep -i \"(COMP_CTX_new|COMP_CTX_free)\"\n0000000000000110 T COMP_CTX_free\n0000000000000000 T COMP_CTX_new\n</code></pre> <p>Even more egregious is the answer given to auditors who specifically ask about configurations and protocols: \"we don't use weak/wounded/broken ciphers\" or \"we follow best practices.\" The use of compression tells the auditor that you are using wounded protocol in an insecure configuration and you don't follow best practices.

It will always be there, even when not debugging a specific component of a module. If you have thorough code coverage, you will spend less time debugging and more time developing because programs will debug themselves.</p> <p>To use asserts effectively, you should assert everything. That includes parameters upon entering a function, return values from function calls, and any program state.

The potential mistakes are detected via compiler which carries around a lot of contextual information during its code analysis phase. At times, you will receive spurious warnings because the compiler is not that smart. Its understandable and even a good thing (how would you like to be out of a job because a program writes its own programs?). At times you will have to learn how to work with the compiler's warning system to suppress warnings. Notice what was not said: turn off the warnings.</p> <p>Suppressing warnings placates the compiler for spurious noise so you can get to the issues that matter (you are separating the wheat from the chaff). This section will offer some hints and point out some potential minefields. First is an unused parameter (for example, <code>argc</code> or <code>argv</code>). Suppressing unused parameter warnings is especially helpful for C++ and interface programming, where parameters are often unused. For this warning, simply define an \"UNUSED\" macro and warp the parameter:</p> <pre><code>##define UNUSED_PARAMETER(x) ((void)x)\n\u2026\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\nUNUSED_PARAMETER(argc);\nUNUSED_PARAMETER(argv);\n\u2026\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A potential minefield lies near \"comparing unsigned and signed\" values, and <code>-Wconversion</code> will catch it for you. This is because C/C++ promotion rules state the signed value will be promoted to an unsigned value and then compared. That means <code>-1</code> <code>&gt;</code> <code>1</code> after promotion! To fix this, you cannot blindly cast - you must first range test the value:</p> <pre><code>int x = GetX();\nunsigned int y = GetY();\n\nASSERT(x &gt;= 0);\nif(!(x &gt;= 0))\nthrow runtime_error(\"WTF??? X is negative.\");\n\nif(static_cast&lt;unsigned int&gt;(x) &gt; y)\ncout &lt;&lt; \"x is greater than y\" &lt;&lt; endl;\nelse\ncout &lt;&lt; \"x is not greater than y\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre> <p>Notice the code above will debug itself - you don't need to set a breakpoint to see if there is a problem with <code>x</code>. Just run the program and wait for it to tell you there is a problem. If there is a problem, the program will snap the debugger (and more importantly, not call a useless <code>abort()</code> as specified by Posix). It beats the snot out of <code>printf</code> that are removed when no longer needed or pollute outputs.</p> <p>Another conversion problem you will encounter conversion between types, and <code>-Wconversion</code> will also catch it for you. The following will always have an opportunity to fail, and should light up like a Christmas tree:</p> <pre><code>struct sockaddr_in addr;\n\u2026\n\naddr.sin_port = htons(atoi(argv[2]));\n</code></pre> <p>The following would probably serve you much better. Notice <code>atoi</code> and fiends are not used because they can silently fail. In addition, the code is instrumented so you don't need to waste a lot of time debugging potential problems:</p> <pre><code>const char* cstr = GetPortString();\n\nASSERT(cstr != NULL);\nif(!(cstr != NULL))\nthrow runtime_error(\"WTF??? Port string is not valid.\");\n\nistringstream iss(cstr);\nlong long t = 0;\niss &gt;&gt; t;\n\nASSERT(!(iss.fail()));\nif(iss.fail())\nthrow runtime_error(\"WTF??? Failed to read port.\");\n\n// Should this be a port above the reserved range ([0-1024] on Unix)?\nASSERT(t &gt; 0);\nif(!(t &gt; 0))\nthrow runtime_error(\"WTF??? Port is too small\");\n\nASSERT(t &lt; static_cast&lt;long long&gt;(numeric_limits&lt;unsigned int&gt;::max()));\nif(!(t &lt; static_cast&lt;long long&gt;(numeric_limits&lt;unsigned int&gt;::max())))\nthrow runtime_error(\"WTF??? Port is too large\");\n\n// OK to use port\nunsigned short port = static_cast&lt;unsigned short&gt;(t);\n\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>Again, notice the code above will debug itself - you don't need to set a breakpoint to see if there is a problem with <code>port</code>. This code will continue checking conditions, years after being instrumented (assuming to wrote code to read a config file early in the project). There's no need to remove the <code>ASSERT</code>s as with <code>printf</code> since they are silent guardians.</p> <p>Another useful suppression trick is too avoid ignoring return values. Not only is it useful to suppress the warning, its required for correct code. For example, <code>snprint</code> will alert you to truncations through its return value. You should not make them silent truncations by ignoring the warning or casting to <code>void</code>:</p> <pre><code>char path[PATH_MAX];\n\u2026\n\nint ret = snprintf(path, sizeof(path), \"%s/%s\", GetDirectory(), GetObjectName());\nASSERT(ret != -1);\nASSERT(!(ret &gt;= sizeof(path)));\n\nif(ret == -1 || ret &gt;= sizeof(path))\nthrow runtime_error(\"WTF??? Unable to build full object name\");\n\n// OK to use path\n\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>The problem is pandemic, and not just boring user land programs. Projects which offer high integrity code, such as SELinux, suffer silent truncations. The following is from an approved SELinux patch even though a comment was made that it suffered silent truncations in its <code>security_compute_create_name</code> function from <code>compute_create.c</code>.</p> <pre><code>12  int security_compute_create_raw(security_context_t scon,\n13                                  security_context_t tcon,\n14                                  security_class_t   tclass,\n15                                  security_context_t * newcon)\n16  {\n17    char path[PATH_MAX];\n18    char *buf;\n19    size_t size;\n20    int fd, ret;\n21\n22    if (!selinux_mnt) {\n23      errno = ENOENT;\n24      return -1;\n25    }\n26\n27    snprintf(path, sizeof path, \"%s/create\", selinux_mnt);\n28    fd = open(path, O_RDWR);\n</code></pre> <p>Unlike other examples, the above code will not debug itself, and you will have to set breakpoints and trace calls to determine the point of first failure.

This attack is thwarted when proper Authorization is used, which implies that a challenge-response mechanism is required that verifies the identity and authority of the requester.</p> <p>The impact of a successful CSRF attack is limited to the capabilities exposed by the vulnerable application and privileges of the user. For example, this attack could result in a transfer of funds, changing a password, or making a purchase with the user's credentials.

The first thought is to simply grab the target origin (i.e., its hostname and port <code>#</code>) from the URL in the request. However, the application server is frequently sitting behind one or more proxies and the original URL is different from the URL the app server actually receives. If your application server is directly accessed by its users, then using the origin in the URL is fine and you're all set.</p> <p>If you are behind a proxy, there are a number of options to consider.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Configure your application to simply know its target origin: It's your application, so you can find its target origin and set that value in some server configuration entry. This would be the most secure approach as it's defined server side, so it is a trusted value. However, this might be problematic to maintain if your application is deployed in many places, e.g., dev, test, QA, production, and possibly multiple production instances. Setting the correct value for each of these situations might be difficult, but if you can do it via some central configuration and providing your instances to grab value from it, that's great! (Note: Make sure the centralized configuration store is maintained securely because major part of your CSRF defense depends on it.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the Host header value: If you prefer that the application find its own target so it doesn't have to be configured for each deployed instance, we recommend using the Host family of headers. The Host header's purpose is to contain the target origin of the request. But, if your app server is sitting behind a proxy, the Host header value is most likely changed by the proxy to the target origin of the URL behind the proxy, which is different than the original URL. This modified Host header origin won't match the source origin in the original Origin or Referer headers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the X-Forwarded-Host header value: To avoid the issue of proxy altering the host header, there is another header called X-Forwarded-Host, whose purpose is to contain the original Host header value the proxy received. Most proxies will pass along the original Host header value in the X-Forwarded-Host header. So that header value is likely to be the target origin value you need to compare to the source origin in the Origin or Referer header.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This mitigation is working properly when origin or referrer headers are present in the requests. Though these headers are included majority of the time, there are few use cases where they are not included (most of them are for legitimate reasons to safeguard users privacy/to tune to browsers ecosystem). The following lists some use cases:</p> <ul> <li>Internet Explorer 11 does not add the Origin header on a CORS request across sites of a trusted zone. The Referer header will remain the only indication of the UI origin. See the following references in Stack Overflow here and here.</li> <li>In an instance following a 302 redirect cross-origin, Origin is not included in the redirected request because that may be considered sensitive information that should not be sent to the other origin.</li> <li>There are some privacy contexts where Origin is set to \"null\" For example, see the following here.</li> <li>Origin header is included for all cross origin requests but for same origin requests, in most browsers it is only included in POST/DELETE/PUT Note: Although it is not ideal, many developers use GET requests to do state changing operations.</li> <li>Referer header is no exception. There are multiple use cases where referrer header is omitted as well (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). Load balancers, proxies and embedded network devices are also well known to strip the referrer header due to privacy reasons in logging them.</li> </ul> <p>Usually, a minor percentage of traffic does fall under above categories (1-2%) and no enterprise would want to lose this traffic. One of the popular technique used across the Internet to make this technique more usable is to accept the request if the Origin/referrer matches your configured list of domains \"OR\" a null value (Examples here. The null value is to cover the edge cases mentioned above where these headers are not sent).

For more information about login CSRF and other risks, see section 3 of this paper.</p> <p>Login CSRF can be mitigated by creating pre-sessions (sessions before a user is authenticated) and including tokens in login form. You can use any of the techniques mentioned above to generate tokens. Remember that pre-sessions cannot be transitioned to real sessions once the user is authenticated - the session should be destroyed and a new one should be made to avoid session fixation attacks.

Client-side CSRF originates when the JavaScript program uses attacker-controlled inputs, such as the URL, for the generation of asynchronous HTTP requests.</p> <p>Note: These variants of CSRF are particularly important as they can bypass some of the common anti-CSRF countermeasures like token-based mitigations and SameSite cookies. For example, when synchronizer tokens or custom HTTP request headers are used, the JavaScript program will include them in the asynchronous requests. Also, web browsers will include cookies in same-site request contexts initiated by JavaScript programs, circumventing the SameSite cookie policies.</p> <p>Client-side vs. Classical CSRF: In the classical CSRF, the vulnerable component is the server-side program, which cannot distinguish whether the incoming authenticated request was performed intentionally, also known as the confused deputy problem. In the client-side CSRF, the vulnerable component is the client-side JavaScript program instead, which allows an attacker to generate arbitrary asynchronous requests, e.g., by manipulating the request endpoint and/or its parameters. Client-side CSRF is an input validation problem, that when exploited, reintroduces the confused deputy flaw, that is, the server-side won't, again, be able to distinguish if the request was performed intentionally or not.</p> <p>For more information about client-side CSRF vulnerabilities, see Sections 2 and 5 of this paper, the CSRF chapter of the SameSite wiki, and this post by the Facebook Whitehat program.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#client-side-csrf-example","title":"Client-side CSRF Example","text":"<p>The following code snippet demonstrates a simple example of a client-side CSRF vulnerability.</p> <pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\nvar csrf_token = document.querySelector(\"meta[name='csrf-token']\").getAttribute(\"content\");\nfunction ajaxLoad(){\n// process the URL hash fragment\nlet hash_fragment = window.location.hash.slice(1);  // hash fragment should be of the format: /^(get|post);(.*)$/\n// e.g., https://site.com/index/#post;/profile\nif(hash_fragment.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; hash_fragment.indexOf(';') &gt; 0 ){\n\nlet params = hash_fragment.match(/^(get|post);(.*)$/);\nif(params &amp;&amp; params.length){\nlet request_method = params[1];   let request_endpoint = params[3];\n\nfetch(request_endpoint, {\nmethod: request_method,\nheaders: {\n'XSRF-TOKEN': csrf_token,\n// [...]\n},\n// [...]\n}).then(response =&gt; { /* [...] */ }); }\n}\n}\n// trigger the async request on page load\nwindow.onload = ajaxLoad();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Vulnerability: In this snippet, the program invokes a function <code>ajaxLoad()</code> upon the page load, which is responsible for loading various webpage elements. The function reads the value of the URL hash fragment (line 4), and extracts two pieces of information from it (i.e., request method and endpoint) to generate an asynchronous HTTP request (lines 11-13). The vulnerability occurs in lines 15-22, when the JavaScript program uses URL fragments to obtain the server-side endpoint for the asynchronous HTTP request (line 15) and the request method. However, both inputs can be controlled by web attackers, who can pick the value of their choosing, and craft a malicious URL containing the attack payload.</p> <p>Attack: For exploitation, attackers can share the malicious URL with the victim (e.g.,  spear-phishing emails) and convince them to click on it, because such URL belongs to the origin of an honest, reputable but vulnerable website. Alternatively, they can use it as a part of an attack page they control and abuse browser APIs (e.g., the <code>window.open()</code> API) to trick the vulnerable JavaScript of the target page to send the HTTP request, which closely resemles the attack model of the classical CSRF attacks.</p> <p>For more examples of client-side CSRF, see this post by the Facebook Whitehat program and this USENIX Security paper.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#client-side-csrf-mitigation-techniques","title":"Client-side CSRF Mitigation Techniques","text":"<p>Independent Requests: Client-side CSRF can be prevented if asynchronous requests are not generated via attacker controllable inputs, such as the URL, window name, document referrer, and postMessages, to name only a few examples.</p> <p>Input Validation: Achieving complete isolaion between inputs and request parameters may not always be possible depending on the context and functionality. In these cases, input validation checks has to be implemented.

This cheatsheet addresses DOM (Document Object Model) based XSS and is an extension (and assumes comprehension of) the XSS Prevention Cheatsheet.</p> <p>In order to understand DOM based XSS, one needs to see the fundamental difference between Reflected and Stored XSS when compared to DOM based XSS. The primary difference is where the attack is injected into the application.</p> <p>Reflected and Stored XSS are server side injection issues while DOM based XSS is a client (browser) side injection issue.</p> <p>All of this code originates on the server, which means it is the application owner's responsibility to make it safe from XSS, regardless of the type of XSS flaw it is. Also, XSS attacks always execute in the browser.</p> <p>The difference between Reflected/Stored XSS is where the attack is added or injected into the application. With Reflected/Stored the attack is injected into the application during server-side processing of requests where untrusted input is dynamically added to HTML. For DOM XSS, the attack is injected into the application during runtime in the client directly.</p> <p>When a browser is rendering HTML and any other associated content like CSS or JavaScript, it identifies various rendering contexts for the different kinds of input and follows different rules for each context. A rendering context is associated with the parsing of HTML tags and their attributes.</p> <ul> <li>The HTML parser of the rendering context dictates how data is presented and laid out on the page and can be further broken down into the standard contexts of HTML, HTML attribute, URL, and CSS.</li> <li>The JavaScript or VBScript parser of an execution context is associated with the parsing and execution of script code. Each parser has distinct and separate semantics in the way they can possibly execute script code which make creating consistent rules for mitigating vulnerabilities in various contexts difficult. The complication is compounded by the differing meanings and treatment of encoded values within each subcontext (HTML, HTML attribute, URL, and CSS) within the execution context.</li> </ul> <p>For the purposes of this article, we refer to the HTML, HTML attribute, URL, and CSS contexts as subcontexts because each of these contexts can be reached and set within a JavaScript execution context.</p> <p>In JavaScript code, the main context is JavaScript but with the right tags and context closing characters, an attacker can try to attack the other 4 contexts using equivalent JavaScript DOM methods.</p> <p>The following is an example vulnerability which occurs in the JavaScript context and HTML subcontext:</p> <pre><code> &lt;script&gt;\nvar x = '&lt;%= taintedVar %&gt;';\nvar d = document.createElement('div');\nd.innerHTML = x;\ndocument.body.appendChild(d);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Let's look at the individual subcontexts of the execution context in turn.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#rule-1-html-escape-then-javascript-escape-before-inserting-untrusted-data-into-html-subcontext-within-the-execution-context","title":"RULE #1 - HTML Escape then JavaScript Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Subcontext within the Execution Context","text":"<p>There are several methods and attributes which can be used to directly render HTML content within JavaScript.

The document categorizes the 7 OSI model layers into three main attack categories, namely application, Session and Network.</p> <p>TODO: Add Diagram</p> <p>Application attacks focus on rendering applications unavailable by exhausting resources or by making it unusable in a functional way. Session (or protocol) attacks focus on consuming server resources, or resources of intermediary equipment like firewalls and load-balancers. Network (or volumetric) attacks focus on saturating the bandwidth of the network resource. It is important to understand that each of these three attack categories needs to be considered when designing a DoS resilient solution.</p> <p>Note that OSI model layer 1 and 2 are not included in this categorization. In the spirit of providing a complete overview of all DoS type of attacks, we will shortly discuss these layers and how DoS applies to them.</p> <p>The physical layer consists of the networking hardware transmission technologies of a network. It is a fundamental layer underlying the logical data structures of the higher-level functions in a network. Typical DoS scenarios are destruction, obstruction, malfunction. An example is a case where a Georgian elderly woman sliced through an underground cable, resulting in loss of internet for the whole of Armenia.</p> <p>The data layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a wide area network (WAN) or between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment. Typical DoS scenarios are MAC flooding (targeting switch MAC tables) and ARP poisoning.</p> <p>In MAC flooding attacks, a switch is flooded with packets, each with a different source MAC address. The intention is to consume the limited memory used by a switch to store the MAC and physical port translation table (MAC table). The result is that valid MAC addresses are purged and the switch enters a fail-over mode where it will act as a network hub. All data is then forwarded to all ports, resulting in a data leakage. TODO impact in relation to DoS TODO document compact remediation</p> <p>In ARP poisoning attacks a malicious actor sends spoofed ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over the wire. The result is that the attacker's MAC address can be linked to the IP address of a legitimate device on the network. This allows an attacker to intercept, modify or stop data in transit, that was intended for the victim IP address. The ARP protocol is specific to the local area network and could cause a DoS on the wire communication.</p> <p>Packet filtering technology can be used to inspect packets in transit to identify and block offending ARP packets.

Plugins such as TFLint, Checkov, Docker Linter, docker-vulnerability-extension, Security Scan, Contrast Security, etc., help in the security assessment of the IaC.</li> <li>Threat modelling - Build the threat modelling landscape earlier in the development cycle to ensure there is enough visibility of the high-risk, high-volume aspects of the code and flexibility to include security throughout to ensure the assets are safely managed.</li> <li>Managing secrets -  Secrets are confidential data and information such as application tokens required for authentication, passwords, and SSH (Secure Shell) keys. The problem is not the secrets, but where you store them. If you are using a simple text file or SCMs like Git, then the secrets can be easily exposed. Open-source tools such as truffleHog, git-secrets, GitGuardian and similar can be utilized to detect such vulnerable management of secrets. See the Secrets Management Cheat Sheet for more information.</li> <li>Version control - Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Ensure all the changes to the IaC are tracked with the right set of information that helps in any revert operation. The important part is that you\u2019re checking in those changes alongside the features they support and not separately. A feature\u2019s infrastructure requirements should be a part of a feature\u2019s branch or merge request. Git is generally used as the source code version control system.</li> <li> <p>Principle of least privilege - define the access management policies based on the principle of least privilege with the following priority items:</p> <ul> <li>Defining who is and is not authorized to create/update/run/delete the scripts and inventory.</li> <li>Limiting the permissions of authorized IaC users to what is necessary to perform their tasks. The IaC scripts should ensure that the permissions granted to the various resources it creates are limited to what is required for them to perform their work.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Static analysis - Analyzes code in isolation, identifying risks, misconfigurations, and compliance faults only relevant to the IaC itself. Tools such as kubescan, Snyk, Coverity etc, can be leveraged for static analysis of IaC.</p> </li> <li>Open Source dependency check - Analyzes the open source dependencies such as OS packages, libraries, etc., to identify potential risks. Tools such as BlackDuck, Snyk, WhiteSource Bolt for GitHub, and similar can be leveraged for open source dependency analysis of IaC.</li> <li>Container image scan - Image scanning refers to the process of analyzing the contents and the build process of a container image in order to detect security issues, vulnerabilities or potential risks. Open-source tools such as Dagda, Clair, Trivy, Anchore, etc., can be leveraged for container image analysis. CI/CD pipeline and Consolidated reporting - enabling the security checks to be made available in the CI/CD pipeline enables the analysis of each of the code changes, excludes the need for manual intervention, and enables maintaining the history of compliance. Along with consolidated reporting, these integrations enhance the speed of development of a secure IaC codebase. Open-source tools such as Jenkins, etc., can be leveraged to build the CI/CD pipelines, and DefectDojo and OWASP Glue can help in tying the checks together and visualizing the check results in a single dashboard.</li> <li>Artifact signing - Digital signing of artifacts at build time and validation of the signed data before use protects artifacts from tampering between build and runtime, thus ensuring the integrity and provenance of an artifact. Open-source tools such as TUF helps in the digital signing of artifacts.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#deploy","title":"Deploy","text":"<ul> <li>Inventory management:<ul> <li>Commissioning - whenever a resource is deployed, ensure the resource is labeled, tracked and logged as part of the inventory management.</li> <li>Decommissioning - whenever a resource deletion is initiated, ensure the underlying configurations are erased, data is securely deleted and the resource is completely removed from the runtime as well as from the inventory management.</li> <li>Tagging - It is essential to tag cloud assets properly. During IaC operations, untagged assets are most likely to result in ghost resources that make it difficult to detect, visualize, and gain observability within the cloud environment and can affect the posture causing a drift. These ghost resources can add to billing costs, make maintenance difficult, and affect the reliability. The only solution to this is careful tagging and monitoring for untagged resources.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Dynamic analysis - Dynamic analysis helps in evaluating any existing environments and services that it will interoperate with or run on. This helps in uncovering potential risks due to the interoperability. Open-source tools such as ZAP, Burp, GVM, etc., can be leveraged for dynamic analysis.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#runtime","title":"Runtime","text":"<ul> <li>Immutability of infrastructure - The idea behind immutable infrastructure is to build the infrastructure components to an exact set of specifications. No deviation, no changes. If a change to a specification is required, then a whole new set of infrastructure is provisioned based on the updated requirements, and the previous infrastructure is taken out of service as obsolete.</li> <li>Logging - Keeping a record is a critical aspect to keeping an eye on risks. You should enable logging - both security logs and audit logs - while provisioning infrastructure, as they help assess the security risks related to sensitive assets. They also assist in analyzing the root cause of incidents and in identifying potential threats. Open-source tools such as ELK, etc., can be leveraged for log analysis.</li> <li>Monitoring - Continuous monitoring assists in looking out for any security and compliance violations, helps in identifying attacks and also provides alerts upon such incidents. Certain solutions also incorporate new technologies like AI to identify potential threats early. Open-source tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, etc., can be leveraged for monitoring of cloud infrastructure.</li> <li>Runtime threat detection: Implementing a runtime threat detection solution helps in recognizing unexpected application behavior and alerts on threats at runtime. Open-source tools such as Falco, etc., can be leveraged for runtime threat detection. Certain application such as Contrast (Contrast Community Edition) can also detect OWASP Top 10 attacks on the application during runtime and help block them in order to protect and secure the application.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Securing Infrastructure as code: https://www.opcito.com/blogs/securing-infrastructure-as-code</li> <li>Infrastructure as code security: https://dzone.com/articles/infrastructure-as-code-security</li> <li>Shifting cloud security left with infrastructure as code: https://securityboulevard.com/2020/04/shifting-cloud-security-left-with-infrastructure-as-code/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html","title":"Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This article is focused on providing clear, simple, actionable guidance for preventing the entire category of Injection flaws in your applications.

We split it out to emphasize the difference between URL access control and data layer access control. You can't do anything about the data-layer problems with URL access control. And they're not really input validation problems either. But we see DOR manipulation all the time. If we list only \"Messed-up from the Floor-up Access Control\" then people will probably only put in SiteMinder or JEE declarative access control on URLs and call it a day. That's what we're trying to avoid.</p> <p>From Eric Sheridan:</p> <p>An object reference map is first populated with a list of authorized values which are temporarily stored in the session. When the user requests a field (ex: color=654321), the application does a lookup in this map from the session to determine the appropriate column name. If the value does not exist in this limited map, the user is not authorized. Reference maps should not be global (i.e. include every possible value), they are temporary maps/dictionaries that are only ever populated with authorized values.</p> <p>\"A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter.\"</p> <p>I'm \"down\" with DOR's for files, directories, etc. But not so much for ALL databases primary keys. That's just insane, like you are suggesting. I think that anytime database primary keys are exposed, an access control rule is required. There is no way to practically DOR all database primary keys in a real enterprise or post-enterprise system.</p> <p>But, suppose a user has a list of accounts, like a bank where database ID 23456 is their checking account.

In order to provide some depth, we will focus on OPA for the remainder of this cheat sheet.</p> <p>OPA is a project that started in 2016 aimed at unifying policy enforcement across different technologies and systems. It can be used to enforce policies on their platforms (like Kubernetes clusters). When it comes to Kubernetes, RBAC and Pod security policies to impose fine-grained control over the cluster. But again, this will only apply to the cluster but not outside the cluster. That\u2019s where Open Policy Agent (OPA) comes into play. OPA was introduced to create a unified method of enforcing security policy in the stack.</p> <p>OPA is a general-purpose, domain-agnostic policy enforcement tool. It can be integrated with APIs, the Linux SSH daemon, an object store like CEPH, etc. OPA designers purposefully avoided basing it on any other project. Accordingly, the policy query and decision do not follow a specific format. That is, you can use any valid JSON data as request attributes as long as it provides the required data. Similarly, the policy decision coming from OPA can also be any valid JSON data. You choose what gets input and what gets output. For example, you can opt to have OPA return a True or False JSON object, a number, a string, or even a complex data object. Currently, OPA is part of CNCF as an incubating project.</p> <p>Most common use cases of OPA:</p> <ul> <li>Application authorization</li> </ul> <p>OPA enables you to accelerate time to market by providing pre-cooked authorization technology so you don\u2019t have to develop it from scratch. It uses a declarative policy language purpose built for writing and enforcing rules such as, \u201cAlice can write to this repository,\u201d or \u201cBob can update this account.\u201d It comes with a rich suite of tooling to help developers integrate those policies into their applications and even allow the application\u2019s end users to contribute policy for their tenants as well.</p> <p>If you have homegrown application authorization solutions in place, you may not want to rip them out to swap in OPA. At least not yet. But if you are going to be decomposing those monolithic apps and moving to microservices to scale and improve developer efficiency, you\u2019re going to need a distributed authorization system and OPA (or one of the related competitors) could be the answer.</p> <ul> <li>Kubernetes admission control</li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes has given developers tremendous control over the traditional silos of compute, networking and storage. Developers today can set up the network the way they want and set up storage the way they want. Administrators and security teams responsible for the well-being of a given container cluster need to make sure developers don\u2019t shoot themselves (or their neighbors) in the foot.</p> <p>OPA can be used to build policies that require, for example, all container images to be from trusted sources, that prevent developers from running software as root, that make sure storage is always marked with the encrypt bit, that storage does not get deleted just because a pod gets restarted, that limits internet access, etc.</p> <p>OPA integrates directly into the Kubernetes API server, so it has complete authority to reject any resource\u2014whether compute, networking, storage, etc.\u2014that policy says doesn\u2019t belong in a cluster. Moreover, you can expose those policies earlier in the development lifecycle (e.g. the CICD pipeline or even on developer laptops) so that developers can receive feedback as early as possible. You can even run policies out-of-band to monitor results so that administrators can ensure policy changes don\u2019t inadvertently do more damage than good.</p> <ul> <li>Service mesh authorization</li> </ul> <p>And finally, many organizations are using OPA to regulate use of service mesh architectures. So, even if you\u2019re not embedding OPA to implement application authorization logic (the top use case discussed above), you probably still want control over the APIs microservices. You can execute and achieve that by putting authorization policies into the service mesh. Or, you may be motivated by security, and implement policies in the service mesh to limit lateral movement within a microservice architecture. Another common practice is to build policies into the service mesh to ensure your compliance regulations are satisfied even when modification to source code is involved.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Kubernetes_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#limiting-resource-usage-on-a-cluster","title":"Limiting resource usage on a cluster","text":"<p>Resource quota limits the number or capacity of resources granted to a namespace.

It should be noted that authorization at the edge layer has a following limitations:</p> <ul> <li>pushing all authorization decisions to API gateway can quickly become hard to manage in complex ecosystems with many roles and access control rules;</li> <li>API gateway may become a single-point-of-decision that may violate \u201cdefense in depth\u201d principle;</li> <li>operation teams typically own the API gateway, so development teams can not directly make authorization changes, slowing down velocity due to the additional communication and process overhead.</li> </ul> <p>In most cases, development teams implement authorization in both places -- at the edge level at a coarse level of granularity and service level.

The following criteria determine which files and directories are added to the tarball:</p> <ul> <li>If there is either a <code>.gitignore</code> or a <code>.npmignore</code> file, the contents of the file are used as an ignore pattern when preparing the package for publication.</li> <li>If both ignore files exist, everything not located in <code>.npmignore</code> is published to the registry. This condition is a common source of confusion and is a problem that can lead to leaking secrets.</li> </ul> <p>Developers may end up updating the <code>.gitignore</code> file, but forget to update <code>.npmignore</code> as well, which can lead to a potentially sensitive file not being pushed to source control, but still being included in the npm package.</p> <p>Another good practice to adopt is making use of the <code>files</code> property in package.json, which works as a whitelist and specifies the array of files to be included in the package that is to be created and installed (while the ignore file functions as a blacklist). The <code>files</code> property and an ignore file can both be used together to determine which files should explicitly be included, as well as excluded, from the package. When using both, the former the <code>files</code> property in package.json takes precedence over the ignore file.</p> <p>When a package is published, the npm CLI will verbosely display the archive being created.

All of the following and their variants are bad patterns you should avoid:</p> <ul> <li><code>CMD \u201cnpm\u201d \u201cstart\u201d</code></li> <li><code>CMD [\u201cyarn\u201d, \u201cstart\u201d]</code></li> <li><code>CMD \u201cnode\u201d \u201cserver.js\u201d</code></li> <li><code>CMD \u201cstart-app.sh\u201d</code></li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s dig in! I\u2019ll walk you through the differences between them and why they\u2019re all patterns to avoid.</p> <p>The following concerns are key in order to understanding the context for properly running and terminating Node.js Docker applications:</p> <ol> <li>An orchestration engine, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or even just Docker engine itself, needs a way to send signals to the process in the container. Mostly, these are signals to terminate an application, such as <code>SIGTERM</code> and <code>SIGKILL</code>.</li> <li>The process may run indirectly, and if that happens then it\u2019s not always guaranteed that it will receive these signals.</li> <li>The Linux kernel treats processes that run as process ID 1 (PID) differently than any other process ID.</li> </ol> <p>Equipped with that knowledge, let\u2019s begin investigating the ways of invoking the process for a container, starting off with the example from the Dockerfile we\u2019re building:</p> <p><code>CMD \"npm\" \"start\"</code></p> <p>The caveat here is two fold. Firstly, we\u2019re indirectly running the node application by directly invoking the npm client. Who\u2019s to say that the npm CLI forwards all events to the node runtime? It actually doesn\u2019t, and we can easily test that.</p> <p>Make sure that in your Node.js application you set an event handler for the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal which logs to the console every time you\u2019re sending an event. A simple code example should look as follows:</p> <pre><code>function handle(signal) {\n   console.log(`*^!@4=&gt; Received event: ${signal}`)\n}\nprocess.on('SIGHUP', handle)\n</code></pre> <p>Then run the container, and once it\u2019s up specifically send it the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal using the <code>docker</code> CLI and the special <code>--signal</code> command-line flag:</p> <p><code>$ docker kill --signal=SIGHUP elastic\\_archimedes</code></p> <p>Nothing happened, right? That\u2019s because the npm client doesn\u2019t forward any signals to the node process that it spawned.</p> <p>The other caveat has to do with the different ways in which way you can specify the <code>CMD</code> directive in the Dockerfile. There are two ways, and they are not the same:</p> <ol> <li>the shellform notation, in which the container spawns a shell interpreter that wraps the process. In such cases, the shell may not properly forward signals to your process.</li> <li>the execform notation, which directly spawns a process without wrapping it in a shell. It is specified using the JSON array notation, such as: <code>CMD [\u201cnpm\u201d, \u201cstart\u201d]</code>. Any signals sent to the container are directly sent to the process.</li> </ol> <p>Based on that knowledge, we want to improve our Dockerfile process execution directive as follows:</p> <p><code>CMD \\[\"node\", \"server.js\"\\]</code></p> <p>We are now invoking the node process directly, ensuring that it receives all of the signals sent to it, without it being wrapped in a shell interpreter.</p> <p>However, this introduces another pitfall.</p> <p>When processes run as PID 1 they effectively take on some of the responsibilities of an init system, which is typically responsible for initializing an operating system and processes. The kernel treats PID 1 in a different way than it treats other process identifiers. This special treatment from the kernel means that the handling of a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to a running process won\u2019t invoke a default fallback behavior of killing the process if the process doesn\u2019t already set a handler for it.</p> <p>To quote the Node.js Docker working group recommendation on this:\u00a0 \u201cNode.js was not designed to run as PID 1 which leads to unexpected behaviour when running inside of Docker. For example, a Node.js process running as PID 1 will not respond to SIGINT (CTRL-C) and similar signals\u201d.</p> <p>The way to go about it then is to use a tool that will act like an init process, in that it is invoked with PID 1, then spawns our Node.js application as another process whilst ensuring that all signals are proxied to that Node.js process. If possible, we\u2019d like a small as possible tooling footprint for doing so to not risk having security vulnerabilities added to our container image.</p> <p>One such tool is dumb-init which is statically linked and has a small footprint. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll set it up:</p> <pre><code>RUN apk add dumb-init\nCMD [\"dumb-init\", \"node\", \"server.js\"]\n</code></pre> <p>This brings us to the following up to date Dockerfile. You\u2019ll notice that we placed the <code>dumb-init</code> package install right after the image declaration, so we can take advantage of Docker\u2019s caching of layers:</p> <pre><code>FROM node:lts-alpine@sha256:b2da3316acdc2bec442190a1fe10dc094e7ba4121d029cb32075ff59bb27390a\nRUN apk add dumb-init\nENV NODE_ENV production\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY --chown=node:node . .\nRUN npm ci --only=production\nUSER node\nCMD [\"dumb-init\", \"node\", \"server.js\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Good to know: <code>docker kill</code> and <code>docker stop</code> commands only send signals to the container process with PID 1. If you\u2019re running a shell script that runs your Node.js application, then take note that a shell instance\u2014such as <code>/bin/sh</code>, for example\u2014doesn\u2019t forward signals to child processes, which means your app will never get a <code>SIGTERM</code>.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/NodeJS_Docker_Cheat_Sheet.html#6-graceful-tear-down-for-your-nodejs-web-applications","title":"6) Graceful tear down for your Node.js web applications","text":"<p>If we\u2019re already discussing process signals that terminate applications, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re shutting them down properly and gracefully without disrupting users.</p> <p>When a Node.js application receives an interrupt signal, also known as <code>SIGINT</code>, or <code>CTRL+C</code>, it will cause an abrupt process kill, unless any event handlers were set of course to handle it in a different behavior.

Now, imagine hundreds of Node.js web containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, going up and down as needs arise to scale or manage errors. Not the greatest user experience.</p> <p>You can easily simulate this problem. Here\u2019s a stock Fastify web application example, with an inherent delayed response of 60 seconds for an endpoint:</p> <pre><code>fastify.get('/delayed', async (request, reply) =&gt; {\n const SECONDS_DELAY = 60000\n await new Promise(resolve =&gt; {\n     setTimeout(() =&gt; resolve(), SECONDS_DELAY)\n })\n return { hello: 'delayed world' }\n})\n\nconst start = async () =&gt; {\n try {\n   await fastify.listen(PORT, HOST)\n   console.log(`*^!@4=&gt; Process id: ${process.pid}`)\n } catch (err) {\n   fastify.log.error(err)\n   process.exit(1)\n }\n}\n\nstart()\n</code></pre> <p>Run this application and once it\u2019s running send a simple HTTP request to this endpoint:</p> <p><code>$ time curl https://localhost:3000/delayed</code></p> <p>Hit <code>CTRL+C</code> in the running Node.js console window and you\u2019ll see that the curl request exited abruptly. This simulates the same experience your users would receive when containers tear down.</p> <p>To provide a better experience, we can do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Set an event handler for the various termination signals like <code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGTERM</code>.</li> <li>The handler waits for clean up operations like database connections, ongoing HTTP requests and others.</li> <li>The handler then terminates the Node.js process.</li> </ol> <p>Specifically with Fastify, we can have our handler call on fastify.close() which returns a promise that we will await, and Fastify will also take care to respond to every new connection with the HTTP status code 503 to signal that the application is unavailable.</p> <p>Let\u2019s add our event handler:</p> <pre><code>async function closeGracefully(signal) {\n   console.log(`*^!@4=&gt; Received signal to terminate: ${signal}`)\n\n   await fastify.close()\n   // await db.close() if we have a db connection in this app\n   // await other things we should cleanup nicely\n   process.exit()\n}\nprocess.on('SIGINT', closeGracefully)\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', closeGracefully)\n</code></pre> <p>Admittedly, this is more of a generic web application concern than Dockerfile related, but is even more important in orchestrated environments.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/NodeJS_Docker_Cheat_Sheet.html#7-find-and-fix-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-nodejs-docker-image","title":"7) Find and fix security vulnerabilities in your Node.js docker image","text":"<p>See Docker Security Cheat Sheet - Use static analysis tools</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/NodeJS_Docker_Cheat_Sheet.html#8-use-multi-stage-builds","title":"8) Use multi-stage builds","text":"<p>Multi-stage builds are a great way to move from a simple, yet potentially erroneous Dockerfile, into separated steps of building a Docker image, so we can avoid leaking sensitive information.

However, increasing layers of nesting within callback functions can become a problem. Any multistage process can become nested 10 or more levels deep. This problem is referred to as a \"Pyramid of Doom\" or \"Callback Hell\". In such code, the errors and results get lost within the callback. Promises are a good way to write asynchronous code without getting into nested pyramids. Promises provide top-down execution while being asynchronous by delivering errors and results to next <code>.then</code> function.</p> <p>Another advantage of Promises is the way Promises handle errors. If an error occurs in a Promise class, it skips over the <code>.then</code> functions and invokes the first <code>.catch</code> function it finds. This way Promises provide a higher assurance of capturing and handling errors. As a principle, you can make all your asynchronous code (apart from emitters) return promises. It should be noted that Promise calls can also become a pyramid. In order to completely stay away from \"Callback Hell\", flat Promise chains should be used. If the module you are using does not support Promises, you can convert base object to a Promise by using <code>Promise.promisifyAll()</code> function.</p> <p>The following code snippet is an example of \"Callback Hell\":</p> <pre><code>function func1(name, callback) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback\n}\nfunction func2(name, callback) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback\n}\nfunction func3(name, callback) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback\n}\nfunction func4(name, callback) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then calls the callback\n}\n\nfunc1(\"input1\", function(err, result1){\nif(err){\n// error operations\n}\nelse {\n//some operations\nfunc2(\"input2\", function(err, result2){\nif(err){\n//error operations\n}\nelse{\n//some operations\nfunc3(\"input3\", function(err, result3){\nif(err){\n//error operations\n}\nelse{\n// some operations\nfunc4(\"input 4\", function(err, result4){\nif(err){\n// error operations\n}\nelse {\n// some operations\n}\n});\n}\n});\n}\n});\n}\n});\n</code></pre> <p>The above code can be securely written as follows using a flat Promise chain:</p> <pre><code>function func1(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\nfunction func2(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\nfunction func3(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\nfunction func4(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\n\nfunc1(\"input1\")\n.then(function (result){\nreturn func2(\"input2\");\n})\n.then(function (result){\nreturn func3(\"input3\");\n})\n.then(function (result){\nreturn func4(\"input4\");\n})\n.catch(function (error) {\n// error operations\n});\n</code></pre> <p>And using async/await:</p> <pre><code>function async func1(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\nfunction async func2(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\nfunction async func3(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\nfunction async func4(name) {\n// operations that takes a bit of time and then resolves the promise\n}\n\n(async() =&gt; {\ntry {\nlet res1 = await func1(\"input1\");\nlet res2 = await func2(\"input2\");\nlet res3 = await func3(\"input2\");\nlet res4 = await func4(\"input2\");\n} catch(err) {\n// error operations\n}\n})();\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#set-request-size-limits","title":"Set request size limits","text":"<p>Buffering and parsing of request bodies can be a resource intensive task.

Node.js has a single-thread event-driven architecture. By means of this architecture, throughput becomes high and the programming model becomes simpler. Node.js is implemented around a non-blocking I/O event loop. With this event loop, there is no waiting on I/O or context switching. The event loop looks for events and dispatches them to handler functions. Because of this, when CPU intensive JavaScript operations are executed, the event loop waits for them to finish. This is why such operations are called \"blocking\". To overcome this problem, Node.js allows assigning callbacks to IO-blocked events. This way, the main application is not blocked and callbacks run asynchronously. Therefore, as a general principle, all blocking operations should be done asynchronously so that the event loop is not blocked.</p> <p>Even if you perform blocking operations asynchronously, your application may still not serve as expected. This happens if there is a code outside the callback that relies on the code within the callback to run first. For example, consider the following code:</p> <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\nfs.readFile('/file.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {\n// perform actions on file content\n});\nfs.unlinkSync('/file.txt');\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, <code>unlinkSync</code> function may run before the callback, which will delete the file before the desired actions on the file content is done. Such race conditions can also affect the security of your application. An example would be a scenario where authentication is performed in a callback and authenticated actions are run synchronously. In order to eliminate such race conditions, you can write all operations that rely on each other in a single non-blocking function. By doing so, you can guarantee that all operations are executed in the correct order. For example, above code example can be written in a non-blocking way as follows:</p> <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\nfs.readFile('/file.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {\n// perform actions on file content\nfs.unlink('/file.txt', (err) =&gt; {\nif (err) throw err;\n});\n});\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code, call to unlink the file and other file operations are within the same callback.

Express-bouncer and express-brute modules work similarly. They increase the delay for each failed request and can be arranged for a specific route.

However, improper use of HTTP cookies can render an application to several session management vulnerabilities. Some flags can be set for each cookie to prevent these kinds of attacks. <code>httpOnly</code>, <code>Secure</code> and <code>SameSite</code> flags are very important for session cookies. <code>httpOnly</code> flag prevents the cookie from being accessed by client-side JavaScript. This is an effective counter-measure for XSS attacks. <code>Secure</code> flag lets the cookie to be sent only if the communication is over HTTPS. <code>SameSite</code> flag can prevent cookies from being sent in cross-site requests that helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Apart from these, there are other flags like domain, path and expires. Setting these flags appropriately is encouraged, but they are mostly related to cookie scope not the cookie security. Sample usage of these flags is given in the following example:</p> <pre><code>const session = require('express-session');\napp.use(session({\nsecret: 'your-secret-key',\nname: 'cookieName',\ncookie: { secure: true, httpOnly: true, path: '/user', sameSite: true}\n}));\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-appropriate-security-headers","title":"Use appropriate security headers","text":"<p>There are several HTTP security headers that can help you prevent some common attack vectors. The helmet package can help to set those headers:</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst helmet = require(\"helmet\");\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(helmet()); // Add various HTTP headers\n</code></pre> <p>The top-level <code>helmet</code> function is a wrapper around 14 smaller middlewares. Bellow is a list of HTTP security headers covered by <code>helmet</code> middlewares:</p> <ul> <li>Strict-Transport-Security: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) dictates browsers that the application can only be accessed via HTTPS connections. In order to use it in your application, add the following codes:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.hsts()); // default configuration\napp.use(\nhelmet.hsts({\nmaxAge: 123456,\nincludeSubDomains: false,\n})\n); // custom configuration\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>X-Frame-Options: determines if a page can be loaded via a <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> or an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. Allowing the page to be framed may result in Clickjacking attacks.</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.frameguard()); // default behavior (SAMEORIGIN)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>X-XSS-Protection: stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce additional security issues on the client side. As such, it is recommended to set the header as X-XSS-Protection: 0 in order to disable the XSS Auditor, and not allow it to take the default behavior of the browser handling the response.</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.xssFilter()); // sets \"X-XSS-Protection: 0\"\n</code></pre> <p>For moderns browsers, it is recommended to implement a strong Content-Security-Policy policy, as detailed in the next section.</p> <ul> <li>Content-Security-Policy: Content Security Policy is developed to reduce the risk of attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking. It allows content from a list that you decide. It has several directives each of which prohibits loading specific type of a content. You can refer to Content Security Policy Cheat Sheet for detailed explanation of each directive and how to use it. You can implement these settings in your application as follows:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(\nhelmet.contentSecurityPolicy({\n// the following directives will be merged into the default helmet CSP policy\ndirectives: {\ndefaultSrc: [\"'self'\"],  // default value for all directives that are absent\nscriptSrc: [\"'self'\"],   // helps prevent XSS attacks\nframeAncestors: [\"'none'\"],  // helps prevent Clickjacking attacks\nimgSrc: [\"'self'\", \"'http://imgexample.com'\"],\nstyleSrc: [\"'none'\"]\n}\n})\n);\n</code></pre> <p>As this middleware performs very little validation, it is recommended to rely on CSP checkers like CSP Evaluator instead.</p> <ul> <li>X-Content-Type-Options: Even if the server sets a valid <code>Content-Type</code> header in the response, browsers may try to sniff the MIME type of the requested resource. This header is a way to stop this behavior and tell the browser not to change MIME types specified in <code>Content-Type</code> header. It can be configured in the following way:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.noSniff());\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Cache-Control and Pragma: Cache-Control header can be used to prevent browsers from caching the given responses. This should be done for pages that contain sensitive information about either the user or the application. However, disabling caching for pages that do not contain sensitive information may seriously affect the performance of the application. Therefore, caching should only be disabled for pages that return sensitive information. Appropriate caching controls and headers can be set easily using the nocache package:</li> </ul> <pre><code>const nocache = require(\"nocache\");\n\napp.use(nocache());\n</code></pre> <p>The above code sets Cache-Control, Surrogate-Control, Pragma and Expires headers accordingly.</p> <ul> <li>X-Download-Options: This header prevents Internet Explorer from executing downloaded files in the site's context. This is achieved with noopen directive. You can do so with the following piece of code:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.ieNoOpen());\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Expect-CT: Certificate Transparency is a new mechanism developed to fix some structural problems regarding current SSL infrastructure. Expect-CT header may enforce certificate transparency requirements. It can be implemented in your application as follows:</li> </ul> <pre><code>const expectCt = require('expect-ct');\napp.use(expectCt({ maxAge: 123 }));\napp.use(expectCt({ enforce: true, maxAge: 123 }));\napp.use(expectCt({ enforce: true, maxAge: 123, reportUri: 'http://example.com'}));\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>X-Powered-By: X-Powered-By header is used to inform what technology is used in the server side. This is an unnecessary header causing information leakage, so it should be removed from your application. To do so, you can use the <code>hidePoweredBy</code> as follows:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy());\n</code></pre> <p>Also, you can lie about the technologies used with this header. For example, even if your application does not use PHP, you can set X-Powered-By header to seem so.</p> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }));\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#platform-security","title":"Platform Security","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#keep-your-packages-up-to-date","title":"Keep your packages up-to-date","text":"<p>Security of your application depends directly on how secure the third-party packages you use in your application are.

For example, the password \"This is a password longer than 512 bits which is the block size of SHA-256\" is converted to the hash value (in hex): <code>fa91498c139805af73f7ba275cca071e78d78675027000c99a9925e2ec92eedd</code>.</p> <p>A good implementation of PBKDF2 will perform pre-hashing before the expensive iterated hashing phase, but some implementations perform the conversion on each iteration. This can make hashing long passwords significantly more expensive than hashing short passwords. If a user can supply very long passwords, there is a potential denial of service vulnerability, such as the one published in Django in 2013. Manual pre-hashing can reduce this risk but requires adding a salt to the pre-hash step.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#upgrading-legacy-hashes","title":"Upgrading Legacy Hashes","text":"<p>For older applications built using less secure hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA-1, these hashes should be upgraded to modern password hashing algorithms as described above. When the user next enters their password (usually by authenticating on the application), it should be re-hashed using the new algorithm. It would also be good practice to expire the users' current password and require them to enter a new one so that any older (less secure) hashes of their password are no longer useful to an attacker.</p> <p>However, this approach means that old (less secure) password hashes will be stored in the database until the user logs in. Two main approaches can be taken to avoid this dilemma.</p> <p>One method is to expire and delete the password hashes of users who have been inactive for an extended period and require them to reset their passwords to login again. Although secure, this approach is not particularly user-friendly. Expiring the passwords of many users may cause issues for support staff or may be interpreted by users as an indication of a breach.</p> <p>An alternative approach is to use the existing password hashes as inputs for a more secure algorithm. For example, if the application originally stored passwords as <code>md5($password)</code>, this could be easily upgraded to <code>bcrypt(md5($password))</code>. Layering the hashes avoids the need to know the original password; however, it can make the hashes easier to crack. These hashes should be replaced with direct hashes of the users' passwords next time the user logs in.</p> <p>Assume that whatever password hashing method is selected will have to be upgraded in the future. Ensure that upgrading your hashing algorithm is as easy as possible. For a transition period, allow for a mix of old and new hashing algorithms.

While REST is more widely applicable, it is most commonly used within the context of communicating with services via HTTP.</p> <p>The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. A REST API resource is identified by a URI, usually a HTTP URL. REST components use connectors to perform actions on a resource by using a representation to capture the current or intended state of the resource and transferring that representation.</p> <p>The primary connector types are client and server, secondary connectors include cache, resolver and tunnel.</p> <p>REST APIs are stateless. Stateful APIs do not adhere to the REST architectural style. State in the REST acronym refers to the state of the resource which the API accesses, not the state of a session within which the API is called. While there may be good reasons for building a stateful API, it is important to realize that managing sessions is complex and difficult to do securely.</p> <p>Stateful services are out of scope of this Cheat Sheet: Passing state from client to backend, while making the service technically stateless, is an anti-pattern that should also be avoided as it is prone to replay and impersonation attacks.</p> <p>In order to implement flows with REST APIs, resources are typically created, read, updated and deleted. For example, an ecommerce site may offer methods to create an empty shopping cart, to add items to the cart and to check out the cart. Each of these REST calls is stateless and the endpoint should check whether the caller is authorized to perform the requested operation.</p> <p>Another key feature of REST applications is the use of standard HTTP verbs and error codes in the pursuit or removing unnecessary variation among different services.</p> <p>Another key feature of REST applications is the use of HATEOAS or Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State. This provides REST applications a self-documenting nature making it easier for developers to interact with a REST service without prior knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#https","title":"HTTPS","text":"<p>Secure REST services must only provide HTTPS endpoints.

SQL Injection attacks are unfortunately very common, and this is due to two factors:</p> <ol> <li>the significant prevalence of SQL Injection vulnerabilities, and</li> <li>the attractiveness of the target (i.e., the database typically contains all the interesting/critical data for your application).</li> </ol> <p>SQL Injection flaws are introduced when software developers create dynamic database queries constructed with string concatenation which includes user supplied input. To avoid SQL injection flaws is simple. Developers need to either: a) stop writing dynamic queries with string concatenation; and/or b) prevent user supplied input which contains malicious SQL from affecting the logic of the executed query.</p> <p>This article provides a set of simple techniques for preventing SQL Injection vulnerabilities by avoiding these two problems. These techniques can be used with practically any kind of programming language with any type of database. There are other types of databases, like XML databases, which can have similar problems (e.g., XPath and XQuery injection) and these techniques can be used to protect them as well.</p> <p>Primary Defenses:</p> <ul> <li>Option 1: Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)</li> <li>Option 2: Use of Properly Constructed Stored Procedures</li> <li>Option 3: Allow-list Input Validation</li> <li>Option 4: Escaping All User Supplied Input</li> </ul> <p>Additional Defenses:</p> <ul> <li>Also: Enforcing Least Privilege</li> <li>Also: Performing Allow-list Input Validation as a Secondary Defense</li> </ul> <p>Unsafe Example:</p> <p>SQL injection flaws typically look like this:</p> <p>The following (Java) example is UNSAFE, and would allow an attacker to inject code into the query that would be executed by the database.

They are simple to write, and easier to understand than dynamic queries. Parameterized queries force the developer to first define all the SQL code, and then pass in each parameter to the query later. This coding style allows the database to distinguish between code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied.</p> <p>Prepared statements ensure that an attacker is not able to change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker. In the safe example below, if an attacker were to enter the userID of <code>tom' or '1'='1</code>, the parameterized query would not be vulnerable and would instead look for a username which literally matched the entire string <code>tom' or '1'='1</code>.</p> <p>Language specific recommendations:</p> <ul> <li>Java EE \u2013 use <code>PreparedStatement()</code> with bind variables</li> <li>.NET \u2013 use parameterized queries like <code>SqlCommand()</code> or <code>OleDbCommand()</code> with bind variables</li> <li>PHP \u2013 use PDO with strongly typed parameterized queries (using bindParam())</li> <li>Hibernate - use <code>createQuery()</code> with bind variables (called named parameters in Hibernate)</li> <li>SQLite - use <code>sqlite3_prepare()</code> to create a statement object</li> </ul> <p>In rare circumstances, prepared statements can harm performance. When confronted with this situation, it is best to either a) strongly validate all data or b) escape all user supplied input using an escaping routine specific to your database vendor as described below, rather than using a prepared statement.</p> <p>Safe Java Prepared Statement Example:</p> <p>The following code example uses a <code>PreparedStatement</code>, Java's implementation of a parameterized query, to execute the same database query.</p> <pre><code>//\u00a0This\u00a0should\u00a0REALLY\u00a0be\u00a0validated\u00a0too\nString\u00a0custname\u00a0=\u00a0request.getParameter(\"customerName\");\n//\u00a0Perform\u00a0input\u00a0validation\u00a0to\u00a0detect\u00a0attacks\nString\u00a0query\u00a0=\u00a0\"SELECT\u00a0account_balance\u00a0FROM\u00a0user_data\u00a0WHERE\u00a0user_name\u00a0=\u00a0?\u00a0\";\nPreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement( query );\npstmt.setString(\u00a01,\u00a0custname);\nResultSet\u00a0results\u00a0=\u00a0pstmt.executeQuery(\u00a0);\n</code></pre> <p>Safe C# .NET Prepared Statement Example:</p> <p>With .NET, it's even more straightforward. The creation and execution of the query doesn't change. All you have to do is simply pass the parameters to the query using the <code>Parameters.Add()</code> call as shown here.</p> <pre><code>String\u00a0query\u00a0=\u00a0\"SELECT\u00a0account_balance\u00a0FROM\u00a0user_data\u00a0WHERE\u00a0user_name\u00a0=\u00a0?\";\ntry\u00a0{\nOleDbCommand\u00a0command\u00a0=\u00a0new\u00a0OleDbCommand(query,\u00a0connection);\ncommand.Parameters.Add(new OleDbParameter(\"customerName\", CustomerName Name.Text));\nOleDbDataReader\u00a0reader\u00a0=\u00a0command.ExecuteReader();\n//\u00a0\u2026\n}\u00a0catch\u00a0(OleDbException\u00a0se)\u00a0{\n//\u00a0error\u00a0handling\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We have shown examples in Java and .NET but practically all other languages, including Cold Fusion, and Classic ASP, support parameterized query interfaces. Even SQL abstraction layers, like the Hibernate Query Language (HQL) have the same type of injection problems (which we call HQL Injection). HQL supports parameterized queries as well, so we can avoid this problem:</p> <p>Hibernate Query Language (HQL) Prepared Statement (Named Parameters) Examples:</p> <pre><code>//First\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0unsafe\u00a0HQL\u00a0Statement\nQuery\u00a0unsafeHQLQuery\u00a0=\u00a0session.createQuery(\"from\u00a0Inventory\u00a0where\u00a0productID='\"+userSuppliedParameter+\"'\");\n//Here\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0safe\u00a0version\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0query\u00a0using\u00a0named\u00a0parameters\nQuery\u00a0safeHQLQuery\u00a0=\u00a0session.createQuery(\"from\u00a0Inventory\u00a0where\u00a0productID=:productid\");\nsafeHQLQuery.setParameter(\"productid\",\u00a0userSuppliedParameter);\n</code></pre> <p>For examples of parameterized queries in other languages, including Ruby, PHP, Cold Fusion, Perl, and Rust, see the Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet or this site.</p> <p>Developers tend to like the Prepared Statement approach because all the SQL code stays within the application. This makes your application relatively database independent.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#defense-option-2-stored-procedures","title":"Defense Option 2: Stored Procedures","text":"<p>Stored procedures are not always safe from SQL injection. However, certain standard stored procedure programming constructs have the same effect as the use of parameterized queries when implemented safely which is the norm for most stored procedure languages.</p> <p>They require the developer to just build SQL statements with parameters which are automatically parameterized unless the developer does something largely out of the norm. The difference between prepared statements and stored procedures is that the SQL code for a stored procedure is defined and stored in the database itself, and then called from the application. Both of these techniques have the same effectiveness in preventing SQL injection so your organization should choose which approach makes the most sense for you.</p> <p>Note: \"Implemented safely\" means the stored procedure does not include any unsafe dynamic SQL generation. Developers do not usually generate dynamic SQL inside stored procedures. However, it can be done, but should be avoided. If it can't be avoided, the stored procedure must use input validation or proper escaping as described in this article to make sure that all user supplied input to the stored procedure can't be used to inject SQL code into the dynamically generated query. Auditors should always look for uses of <code>sp_execute</code>, <code>execute</code> or <code>exec</code> within SQL Server stored procedures. Similar audit guidelines are necessary for similar functions for other vendors.</p> <p>There are also several cases where stored procedures can increase risk. For example, on MS SQL server, you have 3 main default roles: <code>db_datareader</code>, <code>db_datawriter</code> and <code>db_owner</code>. Before stored procedures came into use, DBA's would give db_datareader or db_datawriter rights to the webservice's user, depending on the requirements. However, stored procedures require execute rights, a role that is not available by default. Some setups where the user management has been centralized, but is limited to those 3 roles, cause all web apps to run under db_owner rights so stored procedures can work. Naturally, that means that if a server is breached the attacker has full rights to the database, where previously they might only have had read-access.</p> <p>Safe Java Stored Procedure Example:</p> <p>The following code example uses a <code>CallableStatement</code>, Java's implementation of the stored procedure interface, to execute the same database query.

Keep in mind that generic table validation functions can lead to data loss as table names are used in queries where they are not expected.</p> <p>For something simple like a sort order, it would be best if the user supplied input is converted to a boolean, and then that boolean is used to select the safe value to append to the query. This is a very standard need in dynamic query creation.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>public\u00a0String\u00a0someMethod(boolean\u00a0sortOrder)\u00a0{\nString\u00a0SQLquery\u00a0=\u00a0\"some\u00a0SQL\u00a0...\u00a0order\u00a0by\u00a0Salary\u00a0\"\u00a0+\u00a0(sortOrder\u00a0?\u00a0\"ASC\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"DESC\");`\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Any time user input can be converted to a non-String, like a date, numeric, boolean, enumerated type, etc. before it is appended to a query, or used to select a value to append to the query, this ensures it is safe to do so.</p> <p>Input validation is also recommended as a secondary defense in ALL cases, even when using bind variables as is discussed later in this article.

Therefore, sessions provide the ability to establish variables \u2013 such as access rights and localization settings \u2013 which will apply to each and every interaction a user has with the web application for the duration of the session.</p> <p>Web applications can create sessions to keep track of anonymous users after the very first user request. An example would be maintaining the user language preference. Additionally, web applications will make use of sessions once the user has authenticated. This ensures the ability to identify the user on any subsequent requests as well as being able to apply security access controls, authorized access to the user private data, and to increase the usability of the application. Therefore, current web applications can provide session capabilities both pre and post authentication.</p> <p>Once an authenticated session has been established, the session ID (or token) is temporarily equivalent to the strongest authentication method used by the application, such as username and password, passphrases, one-time passwords (OTP), client-based digital certificates, smartcards, or biometrics (such as fingerprint or eye retina). See the OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet.</p> <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol (RFC2616 section 5), where each request and response pair is independent of other web interactions. Therefore, in order to introduce the concept of a session, it is required to implement session management capabilities that link both the authentication and access control (or authorization) modules commonly available in web applications:</p> <p></p> <p>The session ID or token binds the user authentication credentials (in the form of a user session) to the user HTTP traffic and the appropriate access controls enforced by the web application. The complexity of these three components (authentication, session management, and access control) in modern web applications, plus the fact that its implementation and binding resides on the web developer's hands (as web development frameworks do not provide strict relationships between these modules), makes the implementation of a secure session management module very challenging.</p> <p>The disclosure, capture, prediction, brute force, or fixation of the session ID will lead to session hijacking (or sidejacking) attacks, where an attacker is able to fully impersonate a victim user in the web application. Attackers can perform two types of session hijacking attacks, targeted or generic. In a targeted attack, the attacker's goal is to impersonate a specific (or privileged) web application victim user.

All developers, software and system designers, and architects should strive to include threat modeling in their software development life cycle. Optimally, you will create your threat models and determine which mitigations are needed during an early stage of the development of a new system, application, or feature. Assessing potential threats during the design phase of your project can save significant resources that might be needed to refactor the project to include risk mitigations during a later phase of the project.</p> <p>When you produce a threat model, you will:</p> <ul> <li>Document how data flows through a system to identify where the system might be attacked.</li> <li>Document as many potential threats to the system as possible.</li> <li>Document security controls that may be put in place to reduce the likelihood or impact   of a potential threat.</li> </ul> <p>Note that throughout the document, the terms \"systems\" and \"applications\" are used interchangeably.

It is fundamental to identify who would want to exploit the assets of a company, how they might use them against the company, and if they would be capable of doing so. Some threats require more expertise or resources, and thus raise the level of threat actor needed. For example, if a threat requires hundreds of thousands of dollars of computing power to implement, it is likely that only organized corporate, criminal, or government actors would be valid threat actors for such a threat. However, with the rise of cloud computing and the prevalence of attack software on the internet, other threats may be easy to implement with relatively little skill and few resources.</p> <p>Impact is a measure of the potential damage caused by a particular threat. Impact and damage can take a variety of forms. A threat may result in damage to physical assets, or may result in obvious financial loss. Indirect loss may also result from an attack, and needs to be considered as part of the impact. For example, if your company's website were defaced this could cause damage to your company's reputation, which may in turn cause a loss of business because of the loss of confidence by your users. Depending on the business you are in, attacks that expose user information could potentially result in a physical threat of harm or loss of life to your users, greatly raising the impact of threats that would allow such exposure.</p> <p>Likelihood is a measure of the possibility of a threat being carried out. A variety of factors can impact the likelihood of a threat being carried out, including how difficult the implementation of the threat is, and how rewarding it would be to the attacker. For example, if a threat required a skilled threat actor with tens of thousands of dollars of computing resources to implement, and the only reward was that they were able to gain access to information that is already public in some other form, the likelihood is low. However, if the threat is relatively easy to accomplish, or if the attacker were to gain valuable information from which they could profit, the likelihood may be higher.</p> <p>Controls are safeguards or countermeasures that you put in place in order to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize potential threats against your information, systems, or other assets.</p> <p>Preventions are controls that may completely prevent a particular attack from being possible. For example, if you identify a threat that your users' personal information may be identified by certain application logging, and you decide to completely remove that logging, you have prevented that particular threat.</p> <p>Mitigations are controls that are put in place to reduce either the likelihood or the impact of a threat, while not necessarily completely preventing it. For example, if you store your user's passwords as hashes in a database, two users who have the same password will have the same hash. Thus, if an attacker has access to the hashed passwords and is able to determine the password associated with one hash, he is easily able to find all the other users who share the same password simply by looking for the same hash. However, if you add salts to each user's password, the cost of this particular attack is greatly increased, as the attacker must crack each password individual. An increase in cost reduces the likelihood, and thus has mitigated the attack.</p> <p>A data flow diagram is a depiction of how information flows through your system. It shows each place that data is input into or output from each process or subsystem. It includes anywhere that data is stored in the system, either temporarily or long-term.</p> <p>A trust boundary (in the context of threat modeling) is a location on the data flow diagram where data changes its level of trust. Any place where data is passed between two processes is typically a trust boundary. If your application reads a file from disk, there's a trust boundary between the application and the file because outside processes and users can modify the data in the file. If your application makes a call to a remote process, or a remote process makes calls to your application, that's a trust boundary. If you read data from a database, there's typically a trust boundary because other processes can modify the data in the database. Any place you accept user input in any form is always a trust boundary.</p> <p>In addition to the above terminologies, it is important to be familiar with the key threat modeling principles defined in the Threat Modeling Manifesto project. Those principles are considered throughout the following steps in this cheat sheet.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html#define-business-objectives","title":"Define Business Objectives","text":"<p>Before starting the threat modeling process it is important to identify business objectives of the applications you are assessing, and to identify security and compliance requirements that may be necessary due to business or government regulation.

You need to do a number of things to setup the virtual patching processes and framework prior to actually having to deal with an identified vulnerability, or worse yet, react to a live web application intrusion. The point is that during a live compromise is not the ideal time to be proposing installation of a web application firewall and the concept of a virtual patch. Tension is high during real incidents and time is of the essence, so lay the foundation of virtual patching when the waters are calm and get everything in place and ready to go when an incident does occur.</p> <p>Here are a few critical items that should be addressed during the preparation phase:</p> <ul> <li>Public/Vendor Vulnerability Monitoring - Ensure that you are signed up for all vendor alert mail-lists for commercial software that you are using. This will ensure that you will be notified in the event that the vendor releases vulnerability information and patching data.</li> <li>Virtual Patching Pre-Authorization \u2013 Virtual Patches need to be implemented quickly so the normal governance processes and authorizations steps for standard software patches need to be expedited. Since virtual patches are not actually modifying source code, they do not require the same amount of regression testing as normal software patches. Categorizing virtual patches in the same group as Anti-Virus updates or Network IDS signatures helps to speed up the authorization process and minimize extended testing phases.</li> <li>Deploy Virtual Patching Tool In Advance - As time is critical during incident response, it would be a poor time to have to get approvals to install new software. For instance, you can install ModSecurity WAF in embedded mode on your Apache servers, or an Apache reverse proxy server. The advantage with this deployment is that you can create fixes for non-Apache back-end servers. Even if you do not use ModSecurity under normal circumstances, it is best to have it \"on deck\" ready to be enabled if need be.</li> <li>Increase HTTP Audit Logging \u2013 The standard Common Log Format (CLF) utilized by most web servers does not provide adequate data for conducting proper incident response. You need to have access to the following HTTP data:<ul> <li>Request URI (including QUERY_STRING)</li> <li>Full Request Headers (including Cookies)</li> <li>Full Request Body (POST payload)</li> <li>Full Response Headers</li> <li>Full Response Body</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Virtual_Patching_Cheat_Sheet.html#identification-phase","title":"Identification Phase","text":"<p>The Identification Phase occurs when an organization becomes aware of a vulnerability within their web application.

Recommend you use ticketing systems you already use such as Jira or you may use a specialized tool such as ThreadFix.</li> <li>Verify the name of the vulnerability - This means that you need to have the proper public vulnerability identifier (such as CVE name/number) specified by the vulnerability announcement, vulnerability scan, etc. If the vulnerability is identified proactively rather than through public announcements, then you should assign your own unique identifier to each vulnerability.</li> <li>Designate the impact level - It is always important to understand the level of criticality involved with a web vulnerability. Information leakages may not be treated in the same manner as an SQL Injection issue.</li> <li>Specify which versions of software are impacted - You need to identify what versions of software are listed so that you can determine if the version(s) you have installed are affected.</li> <li>List what configuration is required to trigger the problem - Some vulnerabilities may only manifest themselves under certain configuration settings.</li> <li>List Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit code or payloads used during attacks/testing - Many vulnerability announcements have accompanying exploit code that shows how to demonstrate the vulnerability.

Two attributes specify minimum and maximum limits: <code>minOccurs</code> and <code>maxOccurs</code>. The default value for both the <code>minOccurs</code> and the <code>maxOccurs</code> attributes is <code>1</code>, but certain elements may require other values. For instance, if a value is optional, it could contain a <code>minOccurs</code> of 0, and if there is no limit on the maximum amount, it could contain a <code>maxOccurs</code> of <code>unbounded</code>, as in the following example:</p> <pre><code>&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"&gt;\n&lt;xs:element name=\"operation\"&gt;\n&lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n&lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n&lt;xs:element name=\"buy\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\n&lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n&lt;xs:all&gt;\n&lt;xs:element name=\"id\" type=\"xs:integer\"/&gt;\n&lt;xs:element name=\"price\" type=\"xs:decimal\"/&gt;\n&lt;xs:element name=\"quantity\" type=\"xs:integer\"/&gt;\n&lt;/xs:all&gt;\n&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n&lt;/xs:element&gt;\n&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n&lt;/xs:element&gt;\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The previous schema includes a root element named <code>operation</code>, which can contain an unlimited (<code>unbounded</code>) amount of buy elements. This is a common finding, since developers do not normally want to restrict maximum numbers of occurrences. Applications using limitless occurrences should test what happens when they receive an extremely large amount of elements to be processed.

You have an exact representation of what happened when connecting to the remote host.</p> <p>2) Error-based: If you are unable to see the response from the remote server, you may be able to use the error response. Consider a web service leaking details on what went wrong in the SOAP Fault element when trying to establish a connection:</p> <pre><code>java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 401 for URL: http://192.168.1.1:80\n at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStream(HttpURLConnection.java:1459)\n at com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLEntityManager.setupCurrentEntity(XMLEntityManager.java:674)\n</code></pre> <p>3) Timeout-based: Timeouts could occur when connecting to open or closed ports depending on the schema and the underlying implementation. If the timeouts occur while you are trying to connect to a closed port (which may take one minute), the time of response when connected to a valid port will be very quick (one second, for example). The differences between open and closed ports becomes quite clear.</p> <p>4) Time-based: Sometimes differences between closed and open ports are very subtle.

Since this vulnerability is based on the core mechanism of modern web browsers, it's also called a browser side-channel attack. XS-Leaks attacks seek to exploit the fact of seemingly insignificant information that is exchanged in cross-site communications between sites. This information infers answers to the previously asked questions about the victim's user account. Please take a look at the examples provided below:</p> <ul> <li>Is the user currently logged in?</li> <li>Is the user ID 1337?</li> <li>Is the user an administrator?</li> <li>Does the user have a person with a particular email address in their contact list?</li> </ul> <p>On the basis of such questions, the attacker might try to deduce the answers, depending on the application's context. In most cases, the answers will be in binary form (yes or no). The impact of this vulnerability depends strongly on the application's risk profile.
